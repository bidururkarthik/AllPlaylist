## Additional Information

### Styling

This project uses a combination of styling methods:

- **Styled-Components**: I have used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for component-level styling. It allows writing CSS in JavaScript and ensures styles are scoped to components.

- **Vanilla CSS**: Some global styles and layout-related CSS are written using traditional CSS. This is used for styles that apply across multiple components or for legacy styles.

- **Custom Theme**: A custom theme is implemented to manage styles centrally. Modify the theme in the `src/styles/theme.js` file.

### State Management

- **Redux**: The application uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. Redux is set up in the `src/store` directory, with reducers combined in `rootReducer.js`.

- **Actions and Reducers**: Defined in the `src/redux` directory. Each module has its own slice.

- **Usage**: Components use `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks from `react-redux`.
